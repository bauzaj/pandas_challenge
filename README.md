**School Data Analysis using Pandas**

This is a report on the analysis of two files, one containing school data and the other containing student data. The aim of this analysis is to compare the two files using Pandas library in Python, manipulate the data, and report the district summary, the highest and lowest performing schools, reading and math scores by grade, and school performance by spending.

**Files:**

The two files used in this analysis are:

schools.csv: a file containing information about schools

students.csv: a file containing information about students


**Libraries Used:**

The analysis used the following libraries:

Pandas
Analysis
Data Cleaning
Before starting the analysis, the data in the two files were cleaned to remove any missing or irrelevant information. The data was then merged using the common column school_name.

**District Summary:**

The district summary was calculated by aggregating data from all schools in the district. This included the total number of schools, total number of students, total budget, average math score, average reading score, percentage of students passing math, percentage of students passing reading, and overall passing rate.

**Highest Performing Schools:**

The highest performing schools were determined based on overall percentage passing, math percentage passing, and reading percentage passing. The top five schools for each category were reported.

**Lowest Performing Schools:**

The lowest performing schools were also determined based on overall percentage passing, math percentage passing, and reading percentage passing. The bottom five schools for each category were reported.

**Reading and Math Scores by Grade:**

The average reading and math scores for each grade were reported.

**School Performance by Spending:**

The analysis also included school performance by spending. This was calculated by grouping schools based on their per student budget and calculating the average math score, average reading score, percentage of students passing math, percentage of students passing reading, and overall passing rate for each spending range. The results were then reported in a table.

**Conclusion**

Using Pandas, we were able to successfully compare and manipulate the school and student data, and report valuable insights into the performance of schools in the district. The analysis showed the district summary, highest and lowest performing schools, reading and math scores by grade, and school performance by spending. This information can be used to make informed decisions on how to improve the overall performance of schools in the district.
